# Automated Whatsapp Message Sender

## What It Does
This Python script automates sending messages to a specified WhatsApp group/user using Selenium WebDriver, allowing users to communicate efficiently through the platform.

## How It Works
1. The script opens WhatsApp Web in a Chrome browser using a specified user data directory(customizable).
2. It searches for a given group name and selects the corresponding group/user.
3. The script sends a predefined message, which can include links, to the selected group/user.
4. It handles potential errors gracefully and closes the browser once the operation is complete.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Selenium library
- ChromeDriver
- A WhatsApp account with an active session on WhatsApp Web

## Installation
- Download the `whatsapp-automated-message-sender.py`
- Edit as you want the code
- Run with python

## Quick Start with .bat File
You can create a `.bat` file to quickly launch the script. Here’s how:

1. Open Notepad (or any text editor).
2. Write the "python `path\to\your\script.py`" save as a .bat file
3. Then copy and paste .bat file "C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup" here
